# LUNGS_SEGMENTATION

n this study, we describe the process of building, fitting,and applying a Deep Learning and Neural Networks meth-ods for segmentation task. The purpose of this research isto develop a deep learning system that can detect with highprecision lungs on X-ray images. The use of deep learningand neural networks in medical image analysis has the po-tential to reduce the workload of healthcare professionalsand enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. Auto-mated lung segmentation systems can perform the task in afraction of the time required by manual segmentation, free-ing up healthcare professionals to focus on other criticaltasks
